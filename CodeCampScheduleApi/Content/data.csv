dot net on Linux: Zero to Hero In Minutes,Don Schenck,213,"08:30",".NET,Linux,.NET Core,ASP .NET,MVC","dot net Core 1.0 is the new dot net. ASP dot net Core 1.0 is the new ASP dot net. dot net on Linux is the new hotness. In only minutes, you'll learn how to install dot net on Linux and create your first program. You'll learn about: the different parts of dot net Core 1.0; package managers and NuGet; the new command line interface (CoreCLI); and a great editor that is not Visual Studio. By the end of this presentation, you will know how to create a C# program that runs on Linux. No smoke, no mirrors, no tricks; it just works. We’ll see how to create a basic MVC program, and then we’ll run that program in a Linux container. Finally, we’ll debug the program, running in a Linux container, *from within Visual Studio running on Windows*. You'll also learn why this is important to you and your organization. Finally, you'll leave with all the tools needed to start right away, including a Developer's Copy of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) that you can start using on your PC or Mac today."
Angular 2 - are we there yet?,Kevin Hennessy,212,"08:30","Angular,JavaScript,web","Just like kids in the back seat of the car on the way to a summer destination, we developers keep asking this question about Angular 2. The answer to the question came on September 14 when the Angular team announced the release of Angular 2. So now is the time to start getting familiar with the new version of this popular JavaScript framework. In this code-centric session we'll first look at a simple app that demonstrates the basic building blocks of Angular 2. From there we'll move on to a more complete application and explore key features of Angular 2 like the router, forms and the HTTP module."
Faster Deployments by Dockerizing ASP dot net Core Applications,Kevin Griffin,213,"09:45","Docker,ASP .NET,.NET Core","Two amazing new technologies are coming into the limelight: ASP dot net Core and Docker. Docker has provided developers the unique ability to package their applications into small, bite-sized containers that allow for quick delivery to any Docker platform around the world. Updating one to thousands of nodes can be done within seconds. ASP dot net Core is a new, radical approach to the platform we have known and loved for fifteen years. New changes to ASP dot net Core to focus on cross-platform support has made it a prime target for dockerizing. In this presentation, you will learn how to build a simple ASP dot net Core application from the ground up, and deploy it to datacenters around the world with few simple commands. Learning Objectives: Attendees will learn about Docker, and how Docker containers work Attendees will learn how to create simple applications with ASP dot net Core Attendees will learn how to package an ASP dot net Core application with Docker for deployment."
Big Data In the Enterprise,Anita Luthra,215,"09:45","big data,enterprise,architecture","For fellow developers/architects/business users. We hear the buzz terms on big data and when we speak of it in the workplace, have you had puzzled looks or questions such as .. where does it fit? Why do we need it? How do we integrate it? We will take a look at how big data fits in the enterprise and an architectural design platform on how to incorporate it. Although the architectural principles apply to big data in general (open source), we will use the layout of the Hortonworks platform as an example. Feel free to come in with your insights, questions, experiences ..."
Building a Better Angular 2 Dev Environment using Visual Studio and TypeScript,Sidney Andrews,212,"09:45","TypeScript,Angular,JavaScript,web","Angular 2 has dramatically changed the way Angular applications are built and this requires you to rethink the way you build Angular applications. When creating our Angular 2 course on edX.org (https://www.edx.org/course/developing-dynamic-web-applications-microsoft-dev216x), the Microsoft authoring team decided very early that we will teach the course using Yeoman generators and Visual Studio Code so that it is open to everyone. In this talk, we are going to talk about some of the things learned while this course was built and how you can use Visual Studio Code to manage your NPM packages, debug your application using lite-server, compile your TypeScript code, customize your environment to hide generated JS files, run Yeoman generators and even run Grunt/Gulp tasks all directly in the IDE. We are also going to look at a ""template"" Angular 2 application that takes advantage of many of these features to give us a developer experience we normally expect from a much more robust IDE. By time we are done, you will be able to run the Yeoman generator yourself on a clean install of Visual Studio Code and get started developing Angular 2 applications today."

Mind Blowing Internet of Things Projects,Dan Thyer,213,"13:45","IOT,Azure,Echo,Amazon Echo,Alexa,Raspberry Pi","We live in an exciting time where more and more everyday items “things” are becoming smart! “Things” have sensors and can communicate to other “things” and can provide control to more “things”! The Internet of Things, IOT, is upon us in a huge way and makers are rapidly inventing cool gadgets every day! See Dan’s latest IOT projects leveraging technology from Microsoft, Amazon Echo and Particle. Dan leverages Microsoft Windows 10 IOT Core running on the Raspberry Pi and connects to services in Azure. Dan uses Bluetooth Beacons and Azure Machine Learning to predict the health of his pets! Dan will also talk about his very own IOT, home automation system that he built that is controlling more than 30 different things with 5 different types of microcontrollers. Most of the code is open source and his articles and videos have about a million views. We will talk about the types of microcontrollers and microprocessors used and the strengths and weaknesses of each."
M V V M Done Right with Xamarin.Forms and Prism,Brian Lagunas,214,"09:45","Xamarin,MVVM,XAML,Xamarin Forms","Xamarin.Forms enables developers to create cross platform native mobile apps, using C# and XAML, from a single codebase. This is especially great if you are an experienced XAML developer, because Xamarin.Forms lets you take your current XAML skills mobile to bridge the gap between the Windows world and the mobile world, and makes you feel comfortable building native cross platform applications. Having said that, if you develop in XAML, you design your apps with MVVM at the core of your app architecture. That’s where the problem lies with Xamarin.Forms. It’s no secret that developing MVVM friendly Xamarin.Forms applications can be challenging to say the least. It’s messaging center is static, it’s dependency service is static, its system for showing alerts requires a page instance, no built-in logging, and the most important issue of them all is that its entire navigation system depends on page instances. Where does this leave us? It leaves you with a not-so MVVM friendly application with static references and Page objects scattered throughout your ViewModels. This makes things much more difficult to test, maintain, scale, and not to mention violates just about every MVVM principle out there. Join Brian Lagunas in this session to learn how we can remove the static classes, remove the page references, and remove the code-behind by leveraging the features of Prism for Xamarin.Forms to create pure MVVM Xamarin.Forms applications with logging, commanding, event aggregation, IoC, MVVM, dialog services, and truly decoupled navigation in your Xamarin.Forms applications."
Software Craftsmanship and Agile Code Games,Mike Clement,215,"15:00","agile,craftsmanship,software craftsmanship","Musicians and athletes spend most of their time practicing, not performing. As software developers if we only practice and learn on the job, then we will continue to make mistakes on code meant for customers. On the job, we can only deliver features as fast as the code base and our skills allow us. We must improve the quality of our skills which will in turn improve the quality of our code base. We must take the time to practice allowing ourselves to improve our skills and develop better “code sense”. Learn how the Software Craftsmanship Manifesto (http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/) provides a framework for us to improve in our craft. By learning a variety of code games we can collect a full toolbelt of activities that will help us improve as individuals. We can then take these games and give others the opportunity to improve and raise the level of the whole community. We’ll take a whirlwind tour of some different agile code games that will help us improve our craft."
